# Complete System Terms Structure

This document defines the complete term structure for Systems 1-10 based on Robert Campbell's framework from "Fisherman's Guide to the Cosmic Order" and "Science and Cosmic Order: A New Prospectus".

| Sub-Term | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Galaxy-Idea | Integrating Idea | Black holes retain synchronicity with universal hydrogen projection via quantum forces |
| Galaxy-Routine | Cyclic Motions | Space-time contraction offset by nuclear fusion; space frame skipping creates black holes |

| Sub-Term | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Planet-Idea | Chemical Integration | EM and gravitational form relates via cyclic routines to planetary events |
| Planet-Routine | Cyclic Modulation | Planets bathed in solar EM energy, modulated by rotation and revolution cycles |
| Planet-Form | Biospheric Evolution | Diverse chemical integration fosters life evolution toward cosmic awareness |

## System 4 - The Primary Creative Process (9 terms as Enneagram)

The enneagram structure with triangle (Law of Three) and hexad (Law of Seven).

### Triangle Terms (Universal - positions 3, 6, 9)

| Position | Term Name | Type | Description |
|----------|-----------|------|-------------|
| 9 | Discretionary Hierarchy | Idea | Universal discretion selecting elements from the void |
| 3 | Idea Transference | Routine | Transfers integrating idea through creative process |
| 6 | Corporeal Body | Form | The living form resulting from creative process |

### Hexad Terms (Particular - positions 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8)

| Position | Term Name | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Perception of Need | Perceives the need initiating creative process |
| 2 | Idea Creation | Creates specific idea to address the need |
| 4 | Organized Input | Organizes input required for manifestation |
| 5 | Physical Action | Physical action transforming idea into form |
| 7 | Quantized Memory | Memory elements guiding the process |
| 8 | Response to Need | Response completing cycle back to need |

### Process Sequence
1 → 4 → 2 → (shock at 3) → 8 → 5 → 7 → (shock at 6) → 9

## System 5 - Complementary Enneagrams (18 terms)

Two complementary enneagrams: objective and subjective orientations.

| Enneagram | Orientation | Terms | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Objective | Outward | 9 | Primary creative process relating outward |
| Subjective | Inward | 9 | Complementary process relating inward |

Each position has both objective and subjective aspects that alternate.

## System 6 - Primary Activity of Enneagrams (27 terms)

The triad (Idea-Routine-Form) applied to each of the 9 enneagram positions.

| Position | Idea | Routine | Form |
|----------|------|---------|------|
| 1 | Perception-Idea | Perception-Routine | Perception-Form |
| 2 | Creation-Idea | Creation-Routine | Creation-Form |
| 3 | Transference-Idea | Transference-Routine | Transference-Form |
| 4 | Input-Idea | Input-Routine | Input-Form |
| 5 | Action-Idea | Action-Routine | Action-Form |
| 6 | Body-Idea | Body-Routine | Body-Form |
| 7 | Memory-Idea | Memory-Routine | Memory-Form |
| 8 | Response-Idea | Response-Routine | Response-Form |
| 9 | Discretion-Idea | Discretion-Routine | Discretion-Form |

## System 7 - Enneagram of Enneagrams (81 terms)

Each of the 9 positions becomes a complete enneagram (9 × 9 = 81).

Structure: Position[1-9].SubPosition[1-9]

Example for Position 1 (Perception of Need):
- 1.1: Perception of Perception
- 1.2: Creation within Perception
- 1.3: Transference within Perception
- 1.4: Input within Perception
- 1.5: Action within Perception
- 1.6: Body within Perception
- 1.7: Memory within Perception
- 1.8: Response within Perception
- 1.9: Discretion within Perception

## System 8 - Objective/Subjective Enneagrams of Enneagrams (162 terms)

Each of the 81 terms has objective and subjective orientations (81 × 2 = 162).

Structure: Orientation.Position[1-9].SubPosition[1-9]
- Objective.1.1 through Objective.9.9 (81 terms)
- Subjective.1.1 through Subjective.9.9 (81 terms)

## System 9 - Each Term an Enneagram of Enneagrams (729 terms)

Each of the 81 positions becomes a complete enneagram (81 × 9 = 729).

Structure: Position[1-9].SubPosition[1-9].SubSubPosition[1-9]

## System 10 - Full Recursive Nesting (6561 terms)

Each of the 729 positions becomes a complete enneagram (729 × 9 = 6561).

Structure: Position[1-9].SubPosition[1-9].SubSubPosition[1-9].SubSubSubPosition[1-9]

This represents the full elaboration of the System with 81 × 81 = 6561 terms.

| Term 2 | Universal Means | Subjective-Universal | Countercurrent identities balancing subjective/objective |
| Term 3 | Particular Goals | Objective-Particular | The goal term directing activity |
| Term 4 | Particular Consequence | Subjective-Particular | Follows from goal through perceptual transposition |
