# System 1 & System 2 Diagram Analysis

Based on Robert Campbell's Fisherman's Guide to the Cosmic Order

## Figure 19: System 2 - Subjective Mode (Coalescence)

The subjective mode diagram shows two key perspectives:

### From Darkness (Passive View)
A vesica piscis shape formed by two overlapping circles with centers labeled 1 and 2. This represents the geometric relationship between the universal and particular centers as seen from the periphery (darkness).

### From Light (Active View)
Two funnel-shaped energy processes facing each other, connected by a wavy "Coalescence" line at the top. Key elements include:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| L₀ | Light at each center (equal intensity) |
| D | Darkness at the shared periphery |
| R₁ | Relational whole formed by Center 1 |
| R₂ | Relational whole formed by Center 2 |
| Coalescence | Mutual identity achieved through perception |

The two relational wholes are **simultaneous and countercurrent**. Just as centers have a common periphery in darkness, they also find a **mutual identity in light**.

## Key Insights from the Text

### Perceptual Transposition
The two modes of System 2 are maintained in dynamic balance through **perceptual transposition** of Center 2. Center 2 alternately:
1. Looks out directly to sky (objective mode)
2. Turns around and faces Center 1 to achieve identity in light (subjective mode)

This alternation between objective outward expression and subjective inward regeneration is fundamental to all higher systems.

### Electromagnetic Energy Connection
The two modes of System 2 exhibit an **alternating polarity** associated with electromagnetic energy:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Explicit | The electromagnetic spectrum - energy in reflux state |
| Implicit | The alternating modes of the creative process |

The frequency/wavelength of electromagnetic energy is determined by the relative partitioning between the two centers:
- **Low frequency** (long wavelength): Energy mostly at Center 1, slow perceptual transposition cycles
- **High frequency** (short wavelength): Energy mostly at Center 2, fast perceptual transposition cycles

### The Flashlight Analogy
Campbell uses a powerful analogy: imagine people on Earth at night, each with a flashlight flickering on and off:
- **Lights ON** = Expressive mode (projecting energy to sky)
- **Lights OFF** = Regenerative mode (recharging batteries)

From space, individual lights would not stand out - the whole Earth would appear as a **universal active interface of light**, presenting a constant unbroken glow that fades out indeterminately in all directions.

This illustrates how System 2's alternating modes are **subsumed within System 1**.

### Subsumption Principle
Each higher system incorporates all properties of lower systems:
- System 2 incorporates **universal wholeness** (System 1) and **perceptive wholeness** (System 2)
- All terms in higher systems are constituted of **interacting centers or wholes**
- All terms transform into one another through **perceptual transpositions**
- Each higher system exhibits a **master interface or axis** with alternating objective-to-subjective perspective

### Transcendence of Space and Time
The first two systems **transcend** what we normally perceive as space and time. They subsume space and time, the origins of which are delineated by System 3.

## Diagram Geometry Summary

### System 1 Geometry
- Single sphere/cone with center (L) and periphery (D)
- Active interface as boundary
- Two perspectives: passive (sphere) and active (cone/funnel)

### System 2 Geometry  
- Vesica piscis (two overlapping circles)
- Two centers: Universal (1) and Particular (2)
- Two modes with different energy flow patterns:
  - Objective: Sequential, timelike succession
  - Subjective: Simultaneous, countercurrent coalescence

## Implementation Notes for C++ Library

The diagrams suggest the following enhancements:

1. **Coalescence Model**: Add explicit coalescence state tracking between centers
2. **Relational Wholes**: Model R₁ and R₂ as emergent properties of center perception
3. **Perceptual Transposition**: Implement the alternation cycle with configurable frequency
4. **Electromagnetic Spectrum Mapping**: Map frequency/wavelength to center partitioning ratio
5. **Flashlight Analogy Simulation**: Model ensemble behavior of multiple System 2 instances
6. **Subsumption Tracking**: Ensure System 2 properly contains System 1 properties
